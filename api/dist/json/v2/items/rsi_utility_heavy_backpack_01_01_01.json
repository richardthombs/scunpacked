  "Description": "Item Type: Heavy Backpack\nCarrying Capacity: 120K SP\nCore Compatibility: Heavy\n\nThe Zeus Exploration Suit has been designed to honor some of the earliest space pioneers, the RSI crews who developed and tested the Zeus, the first commercial spacecraft. While the suit is styled to match those used centuries ago with attachments for a helmet and backpack, it contains all of the modern technology and conveniences expected by present-day explorers. The Zeus offers good resistance to harsh environments and excellent storage space for sample-collecting during EVAs. ",
