  "Description": "An Eclipse silhouetted against a planet is a rare sight, considering that this high-tech, stealth bomber is notorious for striking targets before it's even spotted. After years of military service, Aegis Dynamics, whose logo appears the back of the t-shirt, brought the ship to the civilian market in 2947 to rave review and stellar sales.  ",
