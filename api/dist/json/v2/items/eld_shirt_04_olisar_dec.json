  "Description": "The Stuck at Olisar shirt recreates the infamous ASOP terminal screen frequently seen at Port Olisar. Anyone who's visited this bustling transportation hub can relate to the gnawing fear of seeing this screen appear as a result of Olisar officials clearing abandoned, crashed, or improperly parked spacecraft from their landing pads.
