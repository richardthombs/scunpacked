  "Description": "Thick, ink-black synthetic opioid commonly used as a recreational drug. WiDoW has spread like wildfire throughout the Empire thanks to the fact that it's relatively easy to produce. This also creates a wide variety of quality between batches of the drug. Designed to be injected as a liquid directly into the bloodstream, the name derived from one of the main side effects from extensive use, the drug stains the veins black, creating web-like subcutaneous patterns through the body. Illegal inside the UEE.",
