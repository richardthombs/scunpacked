  "Description": "Contrary to its ominous name, the Revenant is actually a variety of the Altrucia Tree, an indigenous plant of Terra known for its thick and colorful leaves. Geoengineers introduced fields of Altrucias to Hyperion in an effort to break up the dust storms. Although the project failed, the Altrucia trees adapted to the perpetual wind patterns, shedding its leaves and thickening the wood in the trunk. Botanists initially believed that the Altrucias had died, but on closer inspection, discovered that they were quite alive and thus, the name was born.The pods are collected because the pollen is processed and turned into Altruciatoxin.",
