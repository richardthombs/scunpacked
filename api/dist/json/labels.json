Now, while we all run into unavoidable obstacles from time to time, I'm going to encourage you to take a moment to think about what went wrong and three things that you can improve upon for your next contract. It's a little exercise that always helps me improve my performance, and isn't that what life is about? Self improvement? All right, back to the exciting new business at hand! ",

  "Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_001": "I was looking back through my records and wow! You've been doing a fantastic job recently. I've talked about you to some of the other Jr. Logistics Operators, and you didn't hear it from me, but they're pretty jealous I'm working with such a stellar contractor. Keep this up and we'll both be Covalex stars! ",
  "Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_002": "First off, I want to let you know how much I, and everyone here at Covalex Shipping, really appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. You've consistently have been completing contracts above and beyond my expectations. Alright, that's probably enough stroking your ego! ",
  "Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_001": "I'm going to confess, I was a little surprised seeing that report come in from your last contract. You had been doing so well! For now, let's just call it a fluke and focus on the next job, okay? ",
  "Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_002": "I have to ask - were you as disappointed about that last contract as I was? You had such a good record going! But don't worry. Everyone makes mistakes.

As a teenager, Thorson earned the nickname 'Vortex' for the impressive speed and dexterity she displayed behind the drums. As a founding member of Firmament, she helped redefine popular music, making her the most famous and mimicked drummer in the UEE for over a decade.   ",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_02": "Rayari scientists working here at the Hickes Research Outpost created a revolutionary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) in 2938. The drug, known commonly as Ceprozin, has become widely used during cybernetic replacement surgeries, providing pain relief and curbing inflammation without any of the side effects common with other NSAIDs.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_03": "Here, in 2941, Terra Mills researchers combined Cellin's unique soil composition with genetic augmentation to create a new fruit hybrid named the Terraberry. This uniquely tart, purple berry stays ripe longer than most other berries, making it ideal for interstellar shipping.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_04": "Here sits the shelter that saved Bastien Nemitz. In 2930, Crusader Industries hired the noted adventurer to promote the beauty and diversity of their moons by hiking around each one and providing daily updates. Following successful journeys around Cellin and Yela, Nemitz failed to upload a daily diary from Yela on June 24th. A search party was organized but failed to find him. Days later, Nemitz contacted Crusader authorities from this shelter. He'd limped here on a shattered ankle suffering during a terrible fall that also destroyed his mobi. After he was rescued, Nemitz recovered and returned to the Talarine Divide shelter to complete his journey around Yela.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_05": "This shelter was erected in part due to the generous contributions of Ethan Halton's friends and families. The large boulders and rocks that dot the Nakamura Valley have made it a popular destination for unregulated open canopy racers. Sadly, in 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton, unable to handle the track's successive tight turns, died from injuries sustained during a racing crash. To help ensure that other racers would not share Ethan's fate, in 2918, this emergency shelter was erected.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_06": "Mario Kosso was the first head of Crusader's emergency response unit. Established to provide support and rescue services to those who found themselves in need on Crusader's moons, Kosso lead the response to the team's first distress beacon, which came from this basin. It was named in his honor upon his retirement in 2938.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_07": "The famous picture of Yela's ring illuminated against the darkened sky was taken here by noted photographer Juliana Aston in 2918. The vista became so connected to her artwork that in 2928 it was officially named 'Aston Ridge' in her honor.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_08": "Situated above a junction of multiple canyons, Wolf Point earned its name thanks to Crusader surveyor Cally Stroble who had noted excitedly in her initial report that \"Against all odds, it seems a family of wolf-like creatures somehow has found a way to settle the area. Their cries can be heard for kilometers around.\" However, when further investigation proved that the wolves were merely a prank by a fellow surveyor, the name stuck.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_09": "This ridge was named for Crusader's former CEO August Dunlow. Many credit Dunlow's vision as instrumental into transforming Crusader Industries into the company it is today. With that in mind, Dunlow Ridge, with its expansive view of the Daymar landscape, was named in his honor.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_10": "This section of Daymar became known as Eager Flats after an eccentric artist who called it home. Norman Eager gained notoriety in the 2920s for constructing a series of art installations so massive they could be seen by ships flying above the flats. Deemed 'ephemeral art' by Eager, the pieces were not meant to be permanent. Instead, they were slowly degraded and buried by the moon's constantly swirling sands.",

First reported by a stranded pilot, as word spread many other travelers would visit the shelter to try the jam for themselves. In 2927, when a reporter attempted to learn who was leaving the sweet treat, the marmalade supply stopped as mysteriously as it began. However, the tradition has been kept alive to this day by the many visitors who continue to leave preserves at the site.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_13": "Crusader's former lead ship designer, Shelly Ashburn, became enamored with this location for its picturesque angle of Crusader on the horizon.

  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_14": "In 2936, Crusader Industries sponsored a competition to find the best travelogue focused on one of their moons. Donnell Flanagan's account of his exciting experiences took top prize and this location, which featured heavily in his adventures, was named in his honor.",

  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_22": "In 2934, Esther Hurston was kidnapped and put into a stasis pod by outlaws looking to extract a hefty ransom from her family. The ship holding the twelve-year-old's cryo-pod hid here after its reg-tags were compromised. While one outlaw attempted to procure clean reg-tags, salvager Mac Petrosky discovered the ship. He reported its location and even hid nearby to keep an eye on the ship until authorities arrived on the scene. Petrosky was awarded a Commendation from Crusader Security upon the reunion of Esther and her family.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_23": "The infamous Beringer Brothers nicknamed this the \"Goodbye Geyser\" after repeatedly using it to dispose of those opposed to their criminal enterprises during the early 2920s.

  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_26": "Prior to Crusader's purchase of the gas giant and its moons, the UEE Navy controlled this part of the system. Here, in 2904, the UEE Navy established a military installation to support and watch over the shipyards perched in Crusader's upper atmosphere. The facilities were retired and relocated in 2908.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_27": "Strained relations between Hurston and their workforce in late 2927-2929 resulted in a series of riots. In response, Hurston severely limited traffic to and from the planet for nearly 15 standard months. Many workers wished to escape the dangerous situation, but few had the means. One bright spot was the Hurston Hotline, a comm channel that constantly shifted frequency. Those looking to flee the unrest, and lucky enough to know the current channel frequency, could request help leaving the planet. Specific instructions were delivered in person to volunteer pilots and had to be followed exactly. The network of labor activists responsible for the Hurston Hotline during this tumultuous time used this location to shelter fleeing workers prior to moving them out of the system.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_28": "Cellin was named after the youngest sibling in the classic children's story A Gift for Baba,the moon's many dormant volcanoes embodying the character's simmering anger.

  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_32": "During Imperator Costigan's 2944 trip to the Stanton System, he shared a meal here at Gallete Family Farms. Imperator Costigan hoped his visit would draw attention to the hardworking, independent farmers across the Empire that would benefit from the agricultural subsidies legislation being debated by the Senate at the time.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_33": "In 2927, Fakih Borisov introduced a herd of large, genetically modified land crabs to Daymar. Breed to withstand the moon's dry conditions, the crabs roamed this part of Daymar for nearly a decade, but Borisov's dream of turning the moon into a rancher's paradise never came to fruition. A key component to Borisov's plan was for the crab to graze on the moon's limited natural vegetation, yet doing so imbued the animals with an off-putting odor that clung to any products derived from them.  ",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_34": "On August 22, 2924, amateur archaeologist Sonny Pak revealed a fossil that he claimed belonged to a new sentient species that inhabited this moon. News of the discovery spread across the spectrum and excited the scientific community.

His actions were condemned by the scientific community and, after the intervention of the UEE government, the fossil was proven to be a fake.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_35": "Romantics believe that lovers who profess their affection for each other on this ledge will be together forever.

The money wasn't recovered during the arrest, but rumors swirled that the outlaw was in possession of digging implements. Ever since, treasure hunters have flocked here in search of the lost fortune, even though repeated scans have failed to show any sign of it. \\n\\nCrusader Industries discourages people from digging up the area and asks that any displaced ground be placed back where it came from to preserve the moon's natural beauty.",

The catastrophe drove Crusader Industries to tighten regulations on outposts and mandate more frequent maintenance checks on all facilities.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_42": "Crusader Industries commends Bountiful Harvest Hydroponics for their extraordinary response to those in need on Vega. Following the horrific Vanduul attacks on October 5, 2945, Bountiful Harvest produced and donated more emergency food supplies for the Vega relief effort than any other outpost on Crusader's moons. This outpost's extraordinary sacrifice serves as a reminder that the UEE will always stand behind those who come face-to-face with the Vanduul threat.",
  "Crus_HistMarker_Text_43": "Famed actress and noted naturist, Millicent Silverton, would often come to this remote area to camp in the wilderness. She was so fond of the site that she petitioned for its inclusion in the 2941 film \"Onto the Break.\"",

You may have questions about what they will experience in basic training, the safety of your relative/friend, and what kind of contact you can expect during their training and subsequent deployment.\\n\\nWe know that this can be a scary time for some people and hope that this will offer some piece of mind about the wonderful opportunities that can result from this decision.\\n",
  "FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_02": "Standard training begins as the recruits arrive on MacArthur via Naval transport. They are immediately given a choice, known as the Rubicon, which is a final opportunity to reconsider the enlistment. After which, the recruits will be divided into groups and assigned to their training camp, known as a Forge. They will also meet their Divisional Officer who will be their first mentor to train them for Naval Service.\\n\\nAfter an extended period of intense drilling, physical fitness, and education in military theory and technology, the recruits will transition into the Candidacy phase of their training. During this time, they will undergo a series of physical, psychological, and intellectual tests to determine where in the Navy they would be the best fit for. Some may move to the flight academy, some to research, a few may even be detailed for Marine training.\\n\\nFrom this point on, the recruit will receive dedicated training into whatever discipline they’ve been selected for. This will account for the remainder of their training and will end with their first ship assignment which will coincide with the next Invictus week unless there is a need for more specialized training. \\nAfter that, they will deploy.\\n",
  "FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_03": "We understand that the first few weeks away from the recruit are the most difficult for family and friends, but we ask that you refrain from attempting to contact them. \\n\\nTo help, all recruits will send a comm to let their family know that they’ve arrived on MacArthur safely, but as a common practice, we want to keep the recruits focused on these initial phases of their training as they can be crucial in their development. Therefore, we will restrict any inbound communications until after this blackout period ends. After that, you will be able to contact them on a more regular basis as comm access is a weekly privilege.\\n",
  "FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_04": "A Starman’s deployment experience will vary based on their ship assignment and specialty. Many of these can take place far away from active combat zones or in dangerous areas of operations but some of these do end up placing them in harm’s way. You must understand that all of our service men and women will be trained to endure in these high intensity situations.\\n\\nThe Navy does offer several programs for friends and family who are having difficulty coping with a loved one on deployment, so feel free to contact the outreach department at your local Naval station to speak with a counselor who can walk you through the best options to put you at ease. \\n",
  "FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_05": "While many of our personnel find that the Navy can offer a complete career, some are happy to take their experience and training back into the private sector as a Citizen.

Invictus is also a wonderful opportunity for the community to come together with local governments, businesses, and law enforcement to talk about planetary security and outreach.\\n",
  "FleetWeek2950_History_Body_02": "This may come as a surprise, but Invictus actually goes back several centuries to the days when the UEE was known as the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Shortly after the First Tevarin War began in 2541, Humanity suddenly found itself in need of an organized military force at a size previously unneeded. To this point, aside from the hostage situation with the Xi’an in 2530, there had only been local security forces under the control of the central Human government.\\n\\nWith Humanity facing an imminent and overwhelming threat, a fleet needed to be raised and trained quickly. The Tribunal sent out an immediate call for recruits to create this army.\\n\\nTransport ships on each of the settled planets would load up these volunteers and travel to a training facility on Mars known as Invictus. \\n\\nOn the morning of 2542-10-12, families and communities gathered at launch pads around the UPE territories to celebrate those that were going to defend against the alien invaders. As the conflict continued, more recruits would gather on that day to travel to Invictus to begin their training.\\n\\nOver the centuries, as the Empire has expanded, space travel has become even more accessible and most recruits are able to self-report, the need for Invictus Launch Week’s has diminished. The spirit of it, however, is stronger than ever.\\n\\nInvictus is a time to celebrate each other. To celebrate bravery, duty, and commitment to the goals that define Humanity at its finest.\\n\\nWelcome to Invictus 2950.\\n",

  "FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_01": "\"To me, it was never really a choice. I know a lot of people grapple with the decision, but honestly, it never crossed my mind. I mean, both my parents got their Citizenship from military service, so maybe that was a factor. There was a moment though when I touched down on the tarmac, I was suddenly seized with this fear that I wasn’t going to be able to be able to make the cut. That was the scariest thing to me; being afraid that I was going to let down my parents and all the people who proudly wore the uniform before me. Thankfully, the Navy isn’t about me. My brothers and sisters built me up and made me the starman that I am today.\"",
  "FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_02": "\"Growing up, I never really thought that I would be military. I was a rambunctious kid, to put it mildly. Wasn’t great with authority. To be honest, I was on a bad road and by all accounts probably would’ve stayed on it, until a Judge Advocate set me straight instead of sending me to jail. Once I was in, I managed to find the one thing that had been eluding me all my life: a family.\"",
  "FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_03": "“I’m sure you’re talking to a lot of people who joined up wanting to be Aria Reilly or Cal Mason or something, but me? I wanted to learn. To me, all the wonder of the universe was found in nuts and bolts, in shaving fuel efficiency by three percent. That was my rush. If you want to get your hands on the latest in cutting edge technology and work with some of the greatest minds, the UEE Navy is the place to go.”",
  "FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_04": "“I’ll just come right out and say it, the second after I signed up, it felt like I got hit by a ship because it was real now. Was I going to have to fight a Vanduul face-to-face? Hell, was I even going to make it through boot? I mean, I struggled to do a pull-up when I was a kid. What the hell was I thinking? Maybe I could try to get out of it. All these thoughts just ambushed me from that moment up to my Invictus. There was this Lieutenant monitoring all the recruits who must’ve seen how terrified I was. I was fumbling with the seat belt when suddenly the Lieutenant was right in front of me. All he said was “Calm down.” I don’t know. It was part consolation, mostly order, but whatever magic he used. It worked. I wasn’t totally calm when I hit my forge, but I found out everybody was freaking out too. That was our first bond.”",

I knew you’d be against talking to them, but I couldn’t risk it not happening. You have every right to be angry at me for keeping it from you, but you know how you get sometimes. Honestly, I don’t know how to handle you when you get all worked up. You’ve been that way since we were kids. Remember that incident with Mom’s Cutlass? Guess I wanted to avoid all that drama until everything was official. \\n\\nSee... dammit, it’s hard to admit this to you ... Freund Family Fuel is running deep in the red and I don’t see a way out. I did… I did everything I could to try and find a way out, put the house up as collateral for a loan… but nothing worked. Just dumb luck I guess. \\n\\nSelling to Avivar is our only option to stay flying with some creds in our pockets and a shred of dignity. I know you’d argue with all your heart against it, but you don’t know the numbers like I do. This system’s a different place since Dad started all of this. Dad never had to hire a full time turret gunner for protection. Competition’s grown so fierce that the low fuel prices can’t cover our skyrocketing costs. At least if we operate under Avivar’s banner we’ll have some support during these tough times. The business may not be in our name after this, but it’ll still be ours.\\n\\nI know you hate me right now, but just remember that, as your brother, I love you and only want to do what’s best for all of us. Well, whenever you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.\\n\\n-\tJ     \\n\\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**// ",

Guess I didn’t get to the turret fast enough. Adena kept yelling at me that we’d all be dead if the ship was really under attack. \\n\\nBut it’s not like I was dragging my heels. I’ve just never been on a ship this size before. It’s so easy to get turned around on this thing. Almost feels like someone designed this ship specifically for people to get lost on.\\n\\nTy keeps telling me not to worry about it. He keeps reminding me that nobody’s first run goes smoothly. Told me yesterday that “the only way you learn is by living.” This would all be super overwhelming if he wasn’t here. Not to say it’s not nice to talk to you about these things too, but by the time the message reaches you and you have the time to respond, sometimes the moment’s passed.   \\n\\nHeard the Captain and his sister arguing again last night. I’m not sure if they realize how loud they are or maybe they don’t care. Had to crank up the volume on my mobi to drown them out, but then I got worried I’d miss a call to get to the turret, so I turned it back down. Still not sleeping very well. Every little bump wakes me up, then it takes forever to get back to sleep. \\n\\nAt least I’m making some creds and gaining some experience. Once I get paid, I’ll send a portion to Mom. Maybe now that both of us are working things will be a bit easier for her. Oh, did you ever find out how much experience deckhands need on your ship? How great would that be to work this same ship. Sure Mom would love it too. Both her boys, exploring the stars together. Just like she always dreamed. \\n\\nCrap … gotta run. Talk again soon, brother.   \\n\\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//",

I’ve done a full assessment of the ship in its current state and come to a ballpark value. It … well, there’s a lot more work to be done around here than I first thought. I added about half a dozen other fixes to my punch list today... you know what, we should probably talk about this in person. That way I can explain how I got to my total. Fair warning, I don’t think you’ll be thrilled with the news.\\n\\nI know you told me to hold off on repairs for the time being, but I noticed something today that’s a little worrying. The power plant’s having power spikes under normal operations. Could be a busted regulator or something, but it’s best not to strain the system until I figure out what’s going on. Might have to do with those repairs I did to the shield genny the other day. Won’t know until I run a full diagnostic.\\n\\nAlso, I tweaked a few things on the turret for the kid. He wouldn’t stop complaining about how slow and unresponsive it was, so I made a few minor adjustments just to keep him quiet about it. Kid’s eager, and works his tail off, but he’s as green as they come.       \\n\\nOne last thing, I’ve been thinking about your last message, taking Avivar’s buyout seems like the best plan. Know your Dad wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’d understand.   \\n\\nOh, and tell your sister before you go through with it.

This has been a good week for Avivar in the Stanton System. I closed that contract I was telling you about last week. Had to cut them a deal, but like you say, once they experience Avivar’s amazing service, we’ve got ‘em for good. That gives us three in the system. A few more clients like this and we’ll be turning a profit in no time. \\n\\nIn other good news, I’ve been able to convince a local fuel concern, Freund Family Fuel, to meet with me about a possible buyout. They’ve been around for decades and have a number of primo contracts. I’ve drafted the offer so it allows them to operate under the Avivar name as long as they maintain our standards. Considering the state of their ship and employee records, it shouldn’t be hard to get rid of them following the first performance review. It’s their contracts that we really want. Not their aging Starfarer. Will let you know when I’m closing in on a deal so you can give it final approval. \\n\\nI know I’ve only been here a few months, but I see a lot of potential for Avivar in Stanton and have some big plans.

Happy Job Hunting!\\n_______________________________________\\n\\nKEEPING TABS\\n\\nThe first thing you may notice when you open the Contract Manager from the mG Homespace is that there are now four tabs located along the top of your holo-display.\\n\\nGeneral - This tab gathers and displays available local contracts which have been Business and Labor Administration (BLA) certified to meet UEE and local law requirements.  \\nPersonal - These are offers being sent to your account specifically. Users are encouraged to be cautious accepting unsolicited contracts from unknown sources.\\nAccepted - Once you accept an offer, the contract is moved to this tab so that you can quickly access important information relating to it.\\nHistory - When a contract comes to end, either through successful completion or by other means, the record of it is kept here for reference.\\n\\nNEW CONTRACT CATEGORIES\\n\\nWe have introduced new Contract Categories that automatically group offers by type to make it easier to find the type of job you’re interested in. \\n\\nAppointments - These are typically offers used to coordinate and schedule in person meetings.\\nBounty Hunter - Contracts to pursue and track down specific, possibly dangerous individuals.\\nECN - Contracts received through the Emergency Communication Network system.\\nDelivery - Transport-related contracts to move cargo and goods between locations.\\nInvestigation - Used by insurance companies and individuals to acquire information. (This update also improves the data submission tool to allow users to submit applicable information to the client from the Accepted tab*.)\\nMaintenance - Jobs that require manual labor and trade skills such as repair work or hazardous material handling. \\nMercenary - Offers in which the contractor is expected to have combat training, such as escort and security work.\\n\\nACCEPTING CONTRACTS\\n\\nWith the Contract Manager, after carefully reading all the information, you can apply for and accept job offers** directly from your mobiGlas. Once you have accepted a contract, from the Accepted tab you will be able to see a detailed list of objectives, and can now also track and untrack contracts to have it sync with your StarMap app, as well as cancel contracts already in progress***.\\n_______________________________________\\n\\n* Users may choose to submit their data to the client at any point, whether the matter has been fully investigated or not. Any complications to arise from this are the solely the responsibility of the user.\\n** microTech and mobiGlas do not endorse or guarantee any contracts listed in the Contract Manager and are not responsible for any risks associated with accepting uncertified contracts. \\n*** microTech and mobiGlas are not accountable for any and all repercussions related to abandoning contracts.",

While our status as an independent planet allows us latitude to govern as we see fit, you may be surprised to learn that Crusader Industries adheres to many of the legal guidelines set forth by the Empire in order to provide a safe and secure environment for all.  \\n\\nHere are few tips to remember while visiting Crusader and its surrounding sectors:\\n\\n* While the level of crime here is typically no higher than many places in the Empire, visitors should be cautious traveling to more remote areas such as the asteroid belt around the moon Yela since outlaw attacks have been known to occur.\\n\\n* Even though you are in Crusader Security patrolled space, damaging another individual’s ship or interfering with public landing areas are still considered misdemeanors. Note that repeated offenses will be taken very seriously.   \\n\\n* Beware of contract offers that involve the disabling of comm arrays. Unsavory individuals often try to lure unsuspecting victims to do this illegal task for them under false pretenses, and many travellers have fallen for this scam. Know that TAMPERING WITH COMM ARRAYS IS AGAINST THE LAW and endangers other people’s lives. Anyone caught disabling a comm array will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\\n\\n* The moons of Crusader are home to many beautiful sights, and touring them is a must while visiting the area. Just be sure to avoid unmarked outposts, bring plenty of fuel and oxygen, and always locate your closest emergency shelter before setting out an expedition.\\n\\n* Crusader Security encourages individuals to join us in helping promote a safe environment. Whether you help track down a wanted criminal, assist in patrolling nearby sectors, or respond to ECN alerts to help ships in distress, any contributions you make to the community’s overall security will be noted in your records and may go a long way in making up for any previous minor infractions. By working together we can all make Crusader a better place to visit.",

  "Journal_General_Nutrition_Content": "We all lead busy lives, and sometimes making good nutrition choices can be a daunting challenge to say the least! \\n\\nThankfully, by using the NDR and HEI ratings assigned to most commercially available food and drinks, taking better care of yourself has never been easier. Just remember, the *higher* the score, the better the nutrition, and the better you'll feel. \\n\\nNutritional Density Rating (NDR)\\nDevised by Empire Health Services to help people eat healthier, the Nutritional Density Rating (NDR) takes into consideration the food’s concentration of nutrients per 100kcal, the breadth and diversity of nutrients contained, and the nutritional bioavailability. The higher an NDR score, the better a food item is for your overall health. However, it is important to remember that no single food contains all the nutrients a single person needs, so along with eating high-scoring food, the second most important thing an individual can do is consume a wide variety of foods. Here’s to good eating and good health! \\n\\nHydration Efficacy Index (HEI)\\nOriginally created by a team of nutritionists at the University of Jalan to compare the effects of beverage choice on hydration levels during long haul space flights, the Hydration Efficacy Index (HEI) has since been adapted by Empire Health Services as the standard measure by which various drink selections can be compared. By considering such factors as moisture retention, absorbency rates, osmolality, caloric count, and electrolyte levels (specifically sodium and potassium), a beverage can be graded using one standardized index. The higher the score, the more effective the beverage is at keeping the consumer hydrated for longer. Substances like caffeine and alcohol have the potential to decrease the index score by increasing the rate of water loss from the body. Standard filtration system water has a baseline score of 80. \\n\\nDietary Effects\\nIn addition to the baseline scores, many foods and drinks have been additionally labeled with keywords to provide extra information about the potential effects that item will have on your health. Take a look at the list below for some of the most common effects and what they mean.\\n\\nHypertrophic - Provides additional blood flow and nutrients to key muscle groups to make them perform optimally.\\n\\nAtrophic - Restricts blood flow, negatively affecting the muscles, making tasks seem harder.\\n\\nEnergizing - Provides a boost to your energy levels, allowing you to be active for longer.\\n\\nFatiguing - Has a draining effect, causing lethargy and general sense of exhaustion.\\n\\nCognitive Boosting - Encourages brain function by allowing additional focus while performing complicated tasks.\\n\\nCognitive Impairing - Stymies brain activity making it difficult to focus for long durations. \\n\\nHypometabolic - Digests slowly, making you feel satisfied for longer.\\n\\nHypermetabolic - Digests quickly, increasing the likelihood you'll be hungry sooner.\\n\\nHydrating - Helps your body to better absorb water, allowing you to satisfy your thirst for longer.\\n\\nDehydrating - Causes your body to lose water, making you thirstier.\\n\\nHealing - Provides vital nutrients to help your body naturally repair itself. \\n\\nToxic - Contains elements that are detrimental to your health and can cause damage if consumed in large quantities. \\n\\nImmune Boosting - Helps your body stay healthy when exposed to harmful elements.\\n\\nImmune Suppressing - Weakens your body's ability to fight off harmful elements.\\n\\n\\n",

For the past year, the engineers at microTech have been working with industry-leading quantum drive manufacturers to allow our award winning StarMap app to seamlessly integrate with most consumer navigation software. This means you can now set quantum travel routes directly from inside the Starmap you are ready to use the StarMap to set quantum travel routes directly.  \\n\\nTo get started using these new features, follow the quickstart guide below.\\n\\nSafe Travels!\\n\\nThe StarMap App Dev Team\\n\\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\\nSTARMAP QUANTUM TRAVEL QUICKSTART GUIDE\\n\\n1. From your cockpit chair, open up the StarMap app either by accessing it through your mobiGlas or your ship’s holo-display.\\n\\n2. Use the StarMap’s controls to pan and zoom around the map, till you see the destination you wish to travel to. (Remember, you may have to zoom in or out to locate a particular destination.)\\n\\n3. Click on the destination to see a route from your current location highlighted with a green scrolling dashed line. (If the route is inaccessible by a single quantum, it will appear a red static dashed line. If this is the case, you may have to travel to an accessible location first before traveling to your ultimate destination or refill your quantum fuel tank. For any additional issues, contact your quantum drive manufacturer.) \\n\\n4. Once you have your route selected, you can use the button on the lower left labeled “Set As Destination” to transfer these coordinates to your quantum drive’s navigational computer. The route will now be highlighted by green scrolling arrows.\\n\\n5. Close the StarMap and you are now set to begin quantum travel. After spooling your quantum drive in preparation, rotate your ship so that your prow is aimed at the diamond-shaped destination marker on your AR display to calibrate the navigational computer. Once spooled and calibrated, you will be able to initiate quantum to your set location. (Remember, you will not be able to quantum travel again till your drive’s cooldown period ends.)",

Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know.

Hathor indiscriminately stripped the system of its resources then abandoned it. Over the decades, outlaws, squatters, and refugees began to move in as the system slipped into obscurity. It wasn’t until 2931 when Dean Kellar’s infamous run that the UEE realized how dangerous and entrenched these criminals had become and decided to take it back.\\n\\nThe year is now 2934. The UEE is still attempting to restore order by sweeping out the outlaws and squatters who have taken residence in the system.

They entrusted the supervision of the terraforming and settlement to Dr. Marcus Fayel from the University of Persei’s Analytical Research and Quantification campus. Little did they know that Dr. Fayel would not only betray his employees, but he would steal the planet out from under them. On May 3, 2812, all communication with the planet was cut off. Hours later, a single message from Dr. Fayel directed to Hatfield & Harding and the rest of the universe announcing the birth of the Sun’s Eye Fellowship, a new religion based on radical isolationism, and their intent to claim Mya as their own.\\n\\nFayel’s former employers were furious. Against the wishes of the UEE, they assembled a covert team of mercenaries to secure the planet and eliminate Fayel as well as any followers who got in their way. The operation was a brutal massacre. The Fellowship proved to be more than willing to kill and die for their new leader. The mission’s failure led to the eventual dissolution of Hatfield & Harding and complete control of Mya to Fayel and the Fellowship who became known as the Outsiders.",

You should always check the legality of your cargo when entering a new jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\nMy ship was stolen, why am I still receiving fines?\\nUnless you report your vehicle stolen to law enforcement (this can be easily done at an ASOP terminal), you are still considered the legal owner of the ship and are responsible for certain crimes perpetrated by it.\\n\\n\\nWhat are Escalated Fines?\\nTo encourage prompt payment, the Office of Imperial Justice (OIJ) provides offenders a short period where newly acquired fines may be settled at a discounted rate. If payment is not made before this period expires, the fine escalates in both price and severity.\\n\\n\\nWhat happens if I don’t pay my Escalated Fines?\\nIf you accumulate enough unpaid escalated fines you will be issued a crimestat. The heavier your escalated fines, the faster this will happen. The OIJ strongly urges everyone to pay their fines regularly and on time.\\n\\n\\nWhat if I receive a fine in error?\\nIf you think you have received a fine in error, please contact the Issue Council.

More easily transported to provide greater mission flexibility, these rovers and gravlevs often allow tactical responsiveness to a wider variety of terrain and scenarios. When atmospheric conditions become hostile and can impede flight, having a varied motor pool at your disposal can make all the difference.\\n\\nOne of the newest rovers to join the ranks is the G12a from Origin Jumpworks. While it may have the sleek lines the manufacturer is known for, the G12a is reinforced with heavier armor and fortified wheels, and comes armed with a full defensive and offensive suite. When deployed, it will initially serve as a patrol vehicle for landing sites located in active combat areas with severe weather patterns.\\n",

  "fleetweek2950_holoviewer_hercules_desc": "The first active-duty starlifter flight was formed in May 2821, when Crusader Industries delivered a dozen Hercules ships during that year’s Invictus Launch Week. Capable of deploying armored vehicles in the midst of heavy enemy fire, the Hercules proved invaluable to battlefield operations. This was apparent on March 2824, when UEE armed forces were called upon to put down a heavily armed group of pirate forces located on a frontier world near the Xi’an border. Two Hercules squadrons, escorted by deep space support fighters, quietly deployed troops and an armored column which defeated the stunned criminal forces in short order. The battle, previously thought to be a particularly hazardous prospect, was won with no losses of UEE personnel and the resulting capture of information would lead directly to the destruction of two pirate outposts and a small capital ship.\\n\\nWith the recent reintroduction of the Tumbril Nova Tank, the Navy’s fleet of Hercules Starlifters has become busier than ever. However, delivering ground combat vehicles is far from the Hercules’ only task during the ongoing war against the Vanduul. With roads destroyed during the course of attacks, the Hercules Starlifter was a vital part in rescue operations on Urial, rapidly flying in earthmovers and cranes to assist in saving countless lives that would have otherwise perished in the rubble. Logistic vehicles like the Hercules are crucial in the Navy’s ability to respond to the shifting needs of the Empire. \\n",

  "fleetweek2950_holoviewer_mercury_desc": "Good intel is the key to victory. That’s why the UEE Navy is seeking to increase the presence of the Crusader Industries Mercury Star Runner in its fleet this year. Already battle proven on several classified missions, the Mercury has delivered key strategic updates to our forces along the front, including Admiral Bishop himself, that have been the key to multiple hard-earned victories. Especially in “red systems” where comm networks may be non-existent, the Mercury’s ability to carry classified encrypted information has been a boon time and again.\\n\\nAdditionally, thanks to Crusader’s inclusion of a programmable kill switch and optimized security configurations, there is a significantly reduced chance of highly classified information falling into enemy hands. Pair that with the Mercury’s speed, precision, and cutting-edge countermeasures, it becomes easy to see why Navy Intelligence Officers have come to rely on this star runner for ensuring that information is delivered on time and intact. \\n",

  "fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nautilus_desc": "First introduced nearly four centuries ago, Aegis Dynamics’ Nautilus has made an indelible mark upon the Navy’s long and proud history, but it is just as needed today as when it was introduced during the First Tevarin War. The Nautilus has played a crucial role in the ongoing Vanduul War, using its minelaying capabilities to set up perimeter defenses and define the shape of the conflict.  \\n\\nOne such example is the mission known as the ‘Hellkite Run’ that was part of Operation Mandrake in the Oberon system. Flown by sapper specialists Squadron 761, aka the Alley Vipers, Nautilus minelayers were used to severely limit the Vanduul escape options. Working tirelessly while the main fleet engaged with enemy forces, they were able to deploy pockets of mines and weapon platforms with such precision that an entire Vanduul squadron was eliminated before they could escape the system to cause additional harm.\\n",

  "fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nova_desc": "First utilized in the Second Tevarin War, the Nova tank has made a triumphant return to battle in 2948 thanks to efforts of the recently reformed manufacturer Tumbril. Military Historians still recount the original Nova’s performance at the 2605 Battle of Koren Pass where three Nova tanks held off an entire Tevarin strike team for over sixteen hours. While much credit is due to the brave soldiers who fought so valiantly, it is hard to deny that the Nova’s resilience and ferocity allowed for the UEE to prevail that day.\\n\\nThough they are most commonly found in the Army’s arsenal, you’ll find that Nova tanks are playing a pivotal role in the Navy’s combat operations, protecting tactical encampments across the Vanduul front. Its mobility means that it can quickly and effectively redeploy to provide combat support where needed and its resistance to extreme temperatures mean that the Nova can be posted in any number of environments. Knowing they’re protected by the Nova’s battery of arms allows pilots and starmen to work more effectively and creates a safer Empire.\\n",

Recently of note, the Polaris and her crew were on extended patrol in Tayac when they successfully halted an attempted incursion by a Vanduul scouting party, potentially deterring further enemy action in that sector for the foreseeable future.

The UEEN has worked closely with Aegis to perfect the Redeemer during this time to ensure that it will meet and exceed all the operational needs of such an advanced vessel. From the early reports arriving from various test squadrons, including the famous 999, the Redeemer is going to be worth the wait. \\n\\nDesigned to carry significant cargo and troops, the Redeemer will provide support in a variety of combat situations and logistical operations. The state-of-the-art technology employed by Aegis should make the craft one of the easiest to maintain to operational-effective standards.

For years, the Merchant Navy has relied upon the RSI Constellation Taurus to successfully complete those dangerous runs through hostile territory.\\n\\nWith a streamlined chassis that can handle more cargo than any other Constellation variant, the Taurus allows each run to be maximized for efficiency. However, it still provides security above many similar freighters thanks to its utilization of defensive technology developed by RSI for its more military focused ships. One Merchant Navy Taurus, the Aliwent, is a particularly welcome sight for the brave starmen serving at listening posts in Kellog, delivering supplies and much needed care packages.

Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Contract and considered stolen or otherwise misappropriated; Company reserves all rights under law and equity to engage measures and actions necessary to retrieve any and all property, physical, material, intellectual, or otherwise.  The parties agree that the Contract as well as any associated terms herein do not constitute a contract of adhesion.  The parties agree that the Contract and any amendments thereto represent the totality of the complete agreement between Company and Independent Contractor without resort to extrinsic evidence.  This Contract is enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law; if any part of the Contract is deemed unenforceable, that part shall be stricken and the rest of the contract shall continue in full force and effect with any remaining ambiguities interpreted in favor of Company’s intentions as best determined through the resort to extrinsic evidence if necessary.

Once it has safely returned to Mars, the blend is aged for several more years to ensure it has the distinct smooth and mellow profile Radegast is known for. The result is a 40-year-old dram that embraces the adventurous flavor profiles of Angeli with the traditional personality of a Martian whiskey; a drink worthy of coming home for.",

Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design. ",

Anything else in the facility is up for grabs if you want to bother lifting it. Just be sure to deliver our Maze to ~mission(Destination) and we'll be square. Copy? \\n\\nIf you run into any resistance, I'll trust you'll deal with it, but the Maze is the real prize here.\\n\\n-Twitch",

Like I said, there's a bunch of drugs in there, but lucky for you Maze just looks like pieces of tree bark which should make it stand out. If you bring a ship that can hold enough cargo, you're welcome to help yourself to any of the other drugs in there. \\n\\nJust make sure that you can at least haul out the one box of Maze we're paying you for over to ~mission(Destination).\\n\\n-Twitch",

I'm not sure if you've ever danced with that stuff before, but it looks like bits of bark.\\n\\nMy employers want it, but for whatever reason, they aren't willing to declare open war on this group. Apparently they're protected by somebody. Anyway, I tipped off BlacJac about the stash and they're getting ready to raid it. \\n\\nI want you to go in and secure the Maze before the place gets burned. Odds are this stash is gonna be guarded, so make sure you break some weapons. If you want to help yourself to anything else in there, that's on you to bring a ship big enough to haul it out. But at the very least bring a ship that can handle carting off the one box of Maze that's ours to ~mission(Destination). \\n\\nDon't worry about clearing out scavs you find there, either.

  "mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_01_Text": "LAST UPDATED: 2945-03-21_16:44SET\\n\\nOn 2945-03-03 we received our first report of missing BIG BENNY brand vending machines from the Port Olisar commuter hub station. Alby Mollion, the on call manager, explained that a TERRA MILLS SERVICE TECHNICIAN had come to repair the machine and informed him that it would have to be taken to an offsite center. The following week, shift supervisor Tony Losong contacted Terra Mills Service Center to inquire about the repair only to learn that the so-called service technician had not in fact been associated with the company. It was at this point that Crusader Security was contacted by the Port Olisar administrators to look into the matter. Security vids pulled from the station’s feed captured the suspect leaving with the machine in question but so far, facial match has been a dead end. It is surmised that the suspect was wearing spoofs, faux-vis, or some combination thereof. Attempts to track the suspect’s transport also proved futile as the regtags were traced back to a decommissioned hauler. \\n\\nOn 2945-03-05, we received a second report from CryAstro station 1267SC where their Big Benny unit was also taken under the guise of repair. Not long after, dozens of similar reports from other stations around the Crusader sector began to trickle in, stating that a false Terra Mills technician had removed their Big Benny machines. Those separate reports were vetted and indexed under this main casefile once the connection was confirmed. \\n\\nIn the meanwhile, we have been working with Terra Mills to issue a general warning to all Big Benny machine owners to be on the lookout for unscheduled service technicians and that they should always demand to see credentials. An image of the suspect has likewise been circulated. However, since 2945-03-12 there have been no further reports.\\nIn attempt to track down the culprit we have notified scrap yards and secondhand sellers to alert us if someone tries to offer a Big Benny unit for sale. We have also tasked Terra Mills with tracing unusual refill orders surmising that the stolen machines may eventually require more Kacho to be stocked. \\n\\n**EDIT 2945-03-21 ** We did have a possible hit on the VSS we put out on the suspect’s transport, but reached a dead end after we lost the trail near Grim HEX. We currently don’t have the resources to investigate directly, but I have put in a request for a CI to follow up.\\n\\n",

  "mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text": "Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\\n\\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\\n  \\nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.",

Be true and you will find truth.\\n\\n•\tImpact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\\n\\n•\tThe medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\\n\\n•\tFound another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \\n\\n•\tWhile I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \\n\\n•\tYou see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\\n\\n•\tI watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \\n\\n•\tI met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \\n\\n•\tA monument for me to leave behind …\\n\\n",

We realize that there are many fine stations available, so we sincerely appreciate your business and look forward to providing an enjoyable experience.\\n\\nWe would like to call your attention to two important services:\\n\\n*Accessing Your Ship*\\nIf you arrived at the station in a personal craft, Port Olisar is proud to feature UniCorp Limited’s cutting edge all-in-one automated ship organization program, ASOP. To retrieve your vessel, visit one of the ASOP terminals located in the Ship Deck, and once selected, your ship will be delivered to an available landing pad. \\n\\n*Safety Protocols*\\nFor the safety of our guests, Port Olisar has been declared an Armistice Zone. All personal and ship weapons will have safeties automatically engaged within the perimeter of our station. If you would like more information about the Armistice Initiative, please contact a staff member or visit the Advocacy on the spectrum.\\n\\nAlso, please note that Port Olisar and the area above Crusader are a UEE Monitored zone. Our Comm Arrays are linked to the UEE’s Emergency Communication Network (ECN) and, when operational, will alert authorities immediately if you are involved in an accident, crime or life-threatening situation. While traveling, please maintain an active CommLink to ensure continued usage of the ECN.\\n\\nAnd of course, feel free to take advantage of our other top-class amenities:\\n\\n*Big Benny’s Kacho-To-Go*\\nWhenever you’re in the mood to “Grab Eat,” make sure to check out our Big Benny’s Kacho-To-Go vending unit featuring the original noodle recipe made famous on Lo and their new spicy Mathania Red variety!\\n\\n*EZHab Rest Area*\\nWhatever the length of your stay, take a moment to relax in our comfortable and private EZHab sleeping accommodations available for rent. \\n\\n*Complimentary Shuttles*\\nIf your travel plans include a trip to Crusader’s surface, Port Olisar offers daily complimentary shuttles to Platinum Bay landing park in Orison; featuring breathtaking views of Crusader Industries’ famous construction yards. For schedule information, please contact a staff member. \\n\\nIf there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable please do not hesitate to ask any member of our staff or myself. We would be delighted to help you. \\n\\nWith kindest regards,\\nSelma Hoss\\n\\nManaging Director\\nPort Olisar Station, Crusader, Stanton\\n",

Home to a Type-A Main Sequence star and four planets, the system only had a single high-risk candidate for terraforming in its initial scouting report. Shortly after discovery, the system was the site of a tragedy: one of Mythic Horizon’s survey boats was lost with all hands in a meteor strike.\\n\\nAlthough the system is sparsely inhabited, intrepid miners have been known to seek their fortune among the asteroid and lunar debris fields of the Taranis system. Criminal elements have also taken to the fields as refuge or to launch attacks.",
  "ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Demien": "Set up shortly after the UEE claimed Nexus system, Demien was one of the operations/housing/transfer stations set up for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II. The planet was never successfully terraformed though, because the station has a much darker reputation: the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. This incident marked the first serious clash between the UEE and the criminal element that were driven out of their system.\\n\\nThe incident occurred in between shifts, when members of the Horizon Crew slipped aboard the station and murdered anyone they came across. One survivor managed to make it to a comm station and alert authorities. By the time they arrived, there were only outlaws left. Local authorities were significantly outgunned and were forced to call in the Marines to retake the base. The ensuing battle lasted for six hours as Marines and Criminals fought over every centimeter of territory.",
  "ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_DyingStar": "Modeled after the Pyro system, this lawless frontier system features a dim red dwarf known as a \"flare star\" at its core. Six burned-out planets remain, none of which are capable of supporting life due to the violent changes in Pyro's stellar luminosity. Between super-flare events capable of melting ice on the daytime side of Pyro IV, huge sunspots cover a large portion of Pyro's star, greatly reducing its brightness. ",
  "ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Echo11": "A former extraction facility built into the asteroid that it was burrowing into. Echo11 was built by the Hathor Group and abandoned just like they abandoned the system. Since then, it’s become a den for squatters and outlaws.\\n\\nRecently, it’s been used for some of the more aggressive outlaw packs to stage surgical strikes on UEE forces. The base has been launched into the public consciousness after a series of high-risk Advocacy raids attempted to take out members of Argul Dawn who had been preying on supply ships for weeks.",
  "ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_NewHorizon": "Built on the planet Green in Ellis system, New Horizon is home to the Empire's most expensive hotels and extravagant casinos and has just recently been cleared to host both Classic and Blitz races\\n\\nSituated in the lower atmosphere of Green in the Ellis system, New Horizon raceway features some of the most beloved tracks in Murray Cup history. From the classic Old Vanderval route through the Defford Link, racers of all levels flock to the system to hone their skills for a shot at glory in the Murray Cup.",

With an overlooking office space, you won’t ever be far from your business, wherever it may take you.",
  "ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_history": "Aeroview proudly claims to be the oldest established hangar manufacturer in Human space. Their design and construction of hangars goes back more than 300 years. In the 27th century, Arthur Nassir formed the company around a rigid code of business ethics focusing largely on design quality, a dedication to ergonomics, and an extreme respect for client confidentiality. Aeroview also famously reserves the right to refuse service to any non-Citizens. While hangar design and housing is tangential, at best, to piracy, Nassir’s outspoken contempt for those who fly outside the law led to the company’s code. When Aeroview was purchased by Shubin Interstellar, the conditions of the sale insisted that the code be adhered to in perpetuity. /n/nWhile the code remains intact, Aeroview’s original business model does not. The Aeroview hangars of the 28th century were palatial affairs built on a case-by-case basis to the specifications of the social elite capable of owning their own spacecraft. In recent years, Aeroview has adapted their tactics to follow in SELF-LAND’s footsteps (although they would never admit it). Instead of custom-building high-class hangars on an individual basis, they now produce a line of modular “business hangars” priced to sell to successful businessmen and other executive-level clients. Unlike other modular hangar companies, Aeroview does not lease the property on which their hangars are established. This is left up to the individual consumer to determine; the Aeroview hangar can be erected at any point in the UEE given 48-hours notification (24 hours, for a steep rush construction fee). Of special note, Aeroview has found particular success in developing hangars for larger scale craft or craft that require additional space for support equipment. Pilots of ships like Freelancers, with multiple crew housings, or Hornets, with weapons racks and a need for more intensive hull repair facilities, generally find it more cost effective to purchase a single Aeroview hangar rather than multiple SELF-LANDs.",

Featuring handcrafted wood paneling, botanical gardens and dynamic wallscreens, Revel & York hangars will feel more like home than home.",
  "ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_history": "When the Revel & York engineering corporation set about designing its first hangar some thirty years ago, the reaction was laughter. The company, known best for excessively expensive and visibly uncomfortable furniture, was entering a field dominated by aerospace giants. The laughter ceased quickly as the Revel & York “deluxe” line of hangars became the de-facto spacecraft garage of the rich and powerful. The company’s cavernous hangars, established on ideal landing spaces in top-dollar land agreements, earned their standing reputation for excellence and quality. /n/nRevel & York designers work directly with pilots to develop a hangar experience like no other. R&Y is the only company currently constructing modular hangars designed to support merchantman-class spacecraft like the Constellation and Caterpillar, locking them into a valuable if small segment of the population. Their hangar designs have earned their reputation: between interlocking catwalks (with motorized lifts!) to allow pilots to supervise their spacecraft from overhead, to specially designed Greycat PV buggies for transporting ship crews from module to module, everything is designed for not just the elite pilots’ usability but also their overall enjoyment. SELF-LAND and competitors make a place to put your ship; Revel & York makes a place for you to take it in.",

  "ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_history": "Incorporated by Peter Weathermen, a wealthy guild licensed shipper who made his living on the active spacelanes, SELF-LAND hangars have become an ever-present reminder of just how easy it is for Humans to travel the stars. The corporation was founded on the philosophy that the temporary hangars available to transiting pilots were inaccessible, unaffordable and most importantly unsafe. (Weathermen began developing the company after he was jumped by a gang of dock-thugs who stripped his Starfarer to the hull plating.) /n/nStarting in the mid-29th century, SELF-LAND began a franchising-based expansion across the Human-inhabited galaxy. The first SELF-LAND was established by Weathermen on Vann in the Croshaw System. Seemingly overnight, the company had expanded to a dozen worlds … and then a hundred. Today, the SELF-LAND corporation boasts that they maintain at least one facility on every world in the UEE, with some planets (Terra chief among them) having as many as sixty different complexes. SELF-LAND hangars are fully modular and environmentally controlled. Prefabricated out of the most available common metals, they aren’t necessarily attractive to look at … but they are comfortable and familiar. The SELF-LAND experience on a colony world near Vanduul space is exactly the same as that available to a pilot berthing on Earth. The SELF-LAND corporation takes care of everything, from structure design to land titles. Because of their design, the same hangar type can be used in configurations ranging from skyscraping heights, to the breadth of a plain, to stacked underground, or to honeycombed deep within asteroids.",

  "ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_history": "Tom Vivien, Walter Fink and Ulla Gandil were members of the UEE Army Corp of Engineers who specialized in quickly building pressurized landing zones in combat zones during their service. They founded VFG Industrial shortly after being discharged and attempted to bring their expertise to the civilian market. With so many mining groups and terraformers out there, they believed there was a demand for functional and well-crafted hangars in 'non-ideal' conditions. They were correct, clients came in droves, until the Army attempted to sue them for patent theft. The lawsuit claimed that VFG's entire business was built upon proprietary design briefs written for and owned by the Army. VFG tried to settle in for a long fight, but soon began to run out of resources. With a freeze on their business, no more money was coming in, but the three refused to back down./n/nWhen things seemed bleakest, they received a reprieve, of sorts. ArcCorp was very interested in their hangar building methods, specifically for their mining and terraforming subsidiaries, but also to mass-market to the public. The members of VFG were divided. Fink utterly refused to sell to the MegaCorp, but the other two knew they had no choice. The three finally agreed to sell. ArcCorp's lawyers took over their defense and within a matter of weeks managed to work some backroom black magic to hamstring the Army's case. Fink took a substantial buyout and left the firm. Tom Vivien and Ulla Gandil are technically still on the board, but control of the company has shifted to ArcCorp.",
